Thanks to my dear NuN, always by my side through the good and the bad, always strong, always together.
Without you nothing would have been possible, nothing.

Godot! We met very recently, but thanks to you I was able to keep my monsters away, you are my obsession, my mental balance.
Thanks to Godot!"
